# UI Recreation

In this project, I've challenged myself to recreate UIs from non web based software using HTML and CSS. Below are the original UIs, followed by my recreated versions.

## Conclusion

Recreating these interfaces using HTML and CSS was of great benefit to improving my skills. I learned a lot about the intricacies of UI design and how to use CSS to create visually appealing, scalable and functional user interfaces.
